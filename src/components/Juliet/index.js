          Juliet was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Before she could walk she was already drawn to graceful movement, and has been taking dance (and especially ballet-oriented) classes since preschool. She also loves astronomy and is constantly drawing pictures representing the constellations. After being inspired by graphic novel series such as <i>Dog Man</i> and <i>Phoebe and Her Unicorn</i>, she has also taken to creating her own by blending in elements from astronomy, <i>Powerpuff Girls</i>, and <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i>. Patrick has roped her into a shared interest in EAS alarms.

          If given the opportunity, ask Holly about Juliet and her "cane-guins," "jin-jin-you-luh," "no shicken no pain no fin," and "dine-horsies."
