            Michael was born in Indiana, and has lived in Florida, Nebraska, Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Late in his elementary years he hoped to become an athletic shoe designer (yes, you read that correctly), but that soon gave way to background animation until a love of music was awakened during junior high. In high school he discovered an interest in theater and performing arts. All of this led to a move to Nashville, Tennessee, where he pursued a music career while serving in his church's worship band. After marrying Holly, she persuaded him to flesh out <a href='https://www.amazon.com/J-Michael-Smith/e/B01CFG6GZY/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_ebooks_1' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>a fantasy series</a> he had been dreaming up in his head. He is currently a front end web developer that will occassionaly indulge in <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3lxkRvIOZASJuvV5UQY9OQ' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>creating music</a> to share with those who will listen.
