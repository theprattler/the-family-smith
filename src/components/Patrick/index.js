            Patrick was born in Nashville, Tennessee. From an early age he was interested in putting things together, whether they were puzzles, Lincoln Logs, Duplos, marble runs, and eventually Legos. He spent some time taking karate where he was acknowledged by his instructors for his encouragement of his classmates. He is currently in a bowling league and has discovered an interest in baseball. If you spend any time with him he will be happy to discuss all sorts of things with you: weather phenomenon and the instruments used to observe them, world flags, global EAS alarms, and <i>Harry Potter</i> characters, among other things.
