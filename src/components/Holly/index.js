          Holly was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. Throughout her childhood she developed a deep love for pets, especially of the furry kind. That love of nurturing soon spilled over to her group of friends, who nicknamed her "Mama." She's a fantastic writer who doesn't give herself enough credit and enjoys singing when she doesn't believe anyone is listening. There is also a growing list of locally owned coffee shops she likes to frequent. So her ideal situation is sipping a coffee with a snuggly cat in her lap with a "wholesome murder mystery" book in her hand. During the last few months she has begun pursuing an interest in restoring old furniture.
