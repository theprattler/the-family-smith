          Candace likes to <em>bite bite bite bite bite</em>. And <em>grumple grumple grumple</em>. Except between 2am and 6am when she demands all the attention from people who are trying to sleep. She is, after all, the self-proclaimed Queen Diva of this family. Michael thinks she's the worst, but Holly and the kids loyally defend her. Don't tell anyone, but she loves Patrick best, and will try to comfort him when he's upset. But to everyone else she simply growls and complains if you have the audacity to touch her.

          Seriously, she's the worst. (Guess who wrote this bio...)
